# DEEPEYE-AI-POWERED-DEEPFAKE-DETECTION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-
📌 Project Overview
DeepEye is a deep learning-based system designed to detect deepfake videos using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project focuses on identifying forged video content by analyzing spatial and temporal inconsistencies, helping to promote safer online media environments.

🎯 Objective
Detect and classify deepfake content in videos and enhance model performance through preprocessing and data augmentation , reduce the spread of misinformation on digital platforms.

🧠 Key Features
Utilizes CNN and LSTM architectures to detect deepfake video frames.
Applies preprocessing techniques such as frame extraction and face alignment.
Includes data augmentation for robust model training.
Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


🛠️ Technologies Used
1)Python

2)TensorFlow 

3)OpenCV

4)NumPy & Pandas

5)Matplotlib  

📊 Dataset
FaceForensics++ dataset.
Includes both real and manipulated video samples for training and testing.

⚙️ How It Works
 > Extract frames from video input.

 > Detect and crop face regions.

 > Feed frames into the CNN-LSTM model.

 > Classify video as real or fake.

 > Display results with evaluation metrics.

🚀 Results
Achieved 98% accuracy on validation dataset.
Demonstrated strong generalization through precision/recall balance.
Effective detection of subtle manipulations in deepfake content.
